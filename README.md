React.js Application Game
<<<<<<< HEAD
This game allows the user to achieve a high score by clicking on the generated images. Cannot click on the same images more than once, otherwise the game starts over again. I chose to do this game in react.js because, in my opinion, react is a more flexible program and it can do quite a lot more than just html and js by itself.
